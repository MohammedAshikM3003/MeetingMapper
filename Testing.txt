[10:00 AM] John:
Good morning, everyone. Let’s get started with our kickoff meeting for the “MeetingMapper” project. I’ll give a quick overview, and then we’ll discuss responsibilities and timelines.

[10:02 AM] Sarah:
Sounds good. Do we have any initial design requirements or brand guidelines to follow?

[10:03 AM] John:
Yes, we want a clean and modern look. The primary color scheme will be blue and white. I’ll share the brand kit after the call.

[10:05 AM] Mike:
From a frontend perspective, do we have a preferred framework or library?

[10:06 AM] John:
Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for now. We might upgrade to React later.

[10:08 AM] Priya:
What about the backend? Should I use Node.js?

[10:09 AM] John:
Yes, Node.js with Express. Firebase can be used for real-time database and hosting.

[10:12 AM] Sarah:
When do you need the wireframes?

[10:13 AM] John:
Let’s aim for wireframes by Monday. Mike can start frontend integration by mid-week.

[10:15 AM] Mike:
Once I get the wireframes, I’ll create responsive pages. Do we want a dark mode too?

[10:16 AM] John:
Not for the MVP. Let’s keep it simple first.

[10:18 AM] Priya:
I’ll set up the basic API endpoints this weekend. Authentication will be required?

[10:19 AM] John:
Yes. Firebase Auth for login/signup.

[10:20 AM] Sarah:
I’ll use Figma for the wireframes and share a link with comments enabled.

[10:21 AM] John:
Perfect. I’ll check in with each of you on progress by Thursday.
